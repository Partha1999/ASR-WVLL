paper summary:
i have done my work with machine learning for that research paper i collected data from youtube videos,podcast and vlogs.where choose  clean data which can help us to go through a smooth research then we convert audio speech to multiple features like mfcc,roll off, zcr,spec_bw ,spec_bw,rms and chroma stff.then we have trained our dataset with 80%data  then we encoded our feature and finally we apply multiple algorithm for measuring the performance which algorithm giving the best accuracy to detect the speech.
